Statements

In the following:
int myVar = 30;
myVar = 30 is an expression
the whole line is a statement, by adding the data type and the semicolon that made the statement for java, allthough there#
are some exceptions to that.

The expression in the above is one of many different types of expression we see that as an assignment
We can have a method call that is also an expression.

They dont always have to be on the same line, multiple lines can encompass an expression most editors recognise if an expression

Note that whitespace is ignored. This can be useful in making things look readable

Note that indentation is a there to make things look more readable, functionally it has no real use though, unlike something like Python.
Most IDEs will do this by default, although somethimes it can go a bit wrong (cut and paste) and needs come post processing
